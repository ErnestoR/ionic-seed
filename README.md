Ionic v1 Seed
=====================

A starting project for all Ionic 1.0 projects. Features:

- **Proper component based** application architecture
- ES6 / Babel
- Webpack
- ngAnnotate
- SCSS
- Unit testing harness setup Karma, Jasmine, and Sinon

## Why should you use this?

The default project architecture that is generated by the Ionic CLI is fine for hobby projects, but when your team and application need to scale, it quickly runs out of steam. This project is setup [using Google's best practice guidelines for AngularJS projects](http://angularjs.blogspot.com/2014/02/an-angularjs-style-guide-and-best.html), and includes everything you need to get started with unit tests. 

If you're planning on upgrading to Angular 2 / Ionic 2 in the near future, but need to start a new project **today**, using this project will ease the transition to the `@Component` architecture that Angular 2 will bring to the table. Controllers in this seed are completely void of Angular specific syntax, which means they can be ported over to the new architecture quite easily when the time comes. 

## Using this project

```bash
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ModusCreateOrg/ionic-seed
$ npm install -g ionic
$ npm install
$ ionic serve

# add platforms
$ ionic platform add ios
$ ionic build ios
```

## Gotchas
The first time you run `ionic serve`, a browser will open and likely give you
an error, something like `Cannot find www/index.html`. This seems to be due
to the Ionic CLI not waiting until all gulp tasks are complete.

If you wait until Webpack is done, and all gulp tasks are complete, the app
will load. You shouldn't run into this error again.

## Testing
This seed is setup to use PhantomJS for test running, and the Karma spec reporter, which gives you nice output on your specs. It looks like this:

![karma](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/spa/pkr1d5uhq1t8wz1/55ueskxt.png)

There are 2 gulp tasks available for running tests.

`gulp test`

Will start a Karma server, run tests, and then exit.

`gulp tdd` 

Starts a Karma server in watch mode.


## Issues

- Since we're using the Webpack SASS loader, live injection of CSS isn't possible. I'm thinking that we should revert back to using a gulp based SASS build step that will allow us to use live injection of CSS without a full app reload. The Ionic CLI utilizes `tiny-lr` behind the scenes, so everything is already setup to handle this.
- There is no indication when Webpack is done compiling unless you have your terminal open. Maybe look into something like https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-notify-growl to make this more clear.
- Test coverage reporting is broken. Need to look into how to parse the non-transpiled code and get coverage on that. 
- Production builds aren't working with `webpack -p` because, reasons. Not sure exactly why this is happening. 
- Angular 1.5 is out with the new `component` method. Should look into how to upgrade Ionic without breaking everything.

## TODO
- figure out production build
- fix test coverage reporting
- examples of ngCordova integration
- examples of Directive tests
- examples of Service tests
- examples of e2e testing?
